# Weather-Widget
* A browser based weather widget that uses the [navigator geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API/Using_the_Geolocation_API) to determine the users location to determine a 5 day weather forecast for their region.
* Completed solo for my Intro to Third-Party API's (Frontend) course at MITT

## Assignment Details
### Set-up & Instructions
Build and deploy a weather widget that uses the navigator geolocation API to determine the users location and uses that location to obtain the current weather and a 5 day forecast for their region.

### To get started:
* Sign-up for a free API account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Download starter HTML and CSS files 

### Process
* In addition to your grade in SD105, this project will also include a grade for your SD130 - Tools & Automation course according to the following requirements:
* Use version control: Create a PRIVATE repository for your work on this project. Add cmacmitt as a collaborator on your Github repository.
* Include a README file with a brief description of your project.
* Make sensible commits along the way. A project like this should have at least 10 commits. More is probably better for managing your work.
* Make sure your commit messages are following the guideline we've been using in class: If I apply this commit, it will...
* Do your work in a src folder and create a build process using gulp that minifies your js and css files and creates a production version of your code in a dist folder.
* Your default gulp task should run all other tasks in series.
* Your node_modules and dist folder should not be included in your repository.

### Implementation Notes:
* To complete this project you will need to utilize at least 2 different endpoints of the Open Weather Map API, Current Weather Data as well as 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast.
  * NOTE: The oneCall endpoint SHOULD NOT be used for this assignment.
* The forecast is provided in 3 hour blocks, which means you will receive 8 different temperature forecasts per day. The high that is displayed is the highest temperature forecasted for that day, while the low is the lowest temperature forecasted for that day.
* Given we cannot average the condition description and image (it may not be cloudy all day), choose a single time everyday that will be used as the condition for the day.
* Your output should indicate the 'Current Conditions' as today, and the forecast as the next 5 days.
* You will need to use the weather icons provided by the API; you can read more about it here
